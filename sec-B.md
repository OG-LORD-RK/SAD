Alright, buckle up, buddy — I’m about to turn this entire *System Analysis + CBA* PDF into something your brain will actually enjoy remembering. Think of this as the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” summary for your exam… but with systems instead of superheroes. 💥🤓

# 🎯 **SYSTEM ANALYSIS — THE FUN, BRAIN-STICKY VERSION**

Imagine you’re the detective of the IT world. *Systems analysis* is you putting on your Sherlock hat, sipping coffee, and figuring out what’s wrong, what’s needed, and what kind of cool new system can solve it.

---

# 🧠 **WHAT IS SYSTEM ANALYSIS?**

You’re basically doing:

* **Investigate** → What’s the problem?
* **Interrogate** → Who needs what?
* **Analyze** → What does the system *actually* need to do?
* **Plan** → How do we build it?
* **Ensure** → It works, is on time, and doesn’t burn money.

It’s like building a house but starting with:
“Yo, where do you wanna live? Treehouse? Mansion? Hobbit hole?”

---

# 🧑‍💻 **WHO IS A SYSTEM ANALYST?**

Think of them as:

* The **translator** between tech geeks & normal humans
* The **designer** of the system
* The **bridge** between users who WANT things and developers who MAKE things

Basically, they’re the middle child in the IT family… solving fights since forever.

---

# 🚀 **SYSTEM PLANNING & INITIAL INVESTIGATION**

This is the most important part — it’s like deciding whether you want to build a tiny shack or a full luxury villa **before** buying bricks.

Goals:

1. Check if the problem is real
2. Check if the solution is worth the effort
3. Plan steps, talk to people, and guess the future (sort of)

---

## ✏️ **USER REQUEST FORM**

User fills things like:

* What they want
* Why they want it
* Benefits expected
* Inputs/Outputs
* Signatures
  (Yes, paperwork. Welcome to reality.)

---

# 🔍 **INITIAL INVESTIGATION PROCESS**

This is your CSI moment:

1. **Problem definition**
   Find out what the user wants → not what they *say* they want 😭
   Users will say: “I want faster service.”
   But they actually want: “I don’t want customers yelling at me.”

2. **Background analysis**
   Understand how the current system works → aka “what’s broken?”

3. **Fact-finding** → interviews, documents, observation
   This is where you act like a stalker, but professionally.

4. **Fact analysis** → DFDs, decision tables
   Basically drawing fancy circles and arrows.

5. **Feasibility check**
   Is this project worth doing or nah?

---

# 🧩 **COMMON PROBLEMS**

Users:

* Change their mind 12 times
* Don’t know what they want
* Want everything at once
* Forget things
* Give vague descriptions
* Have unrealistic expectations

Strategies analysts use:

* **Kitchen sink** → ask everything
* **Smoking** → request tons of features but need only 1
* **Same thing strategy** → user says “make it like the old one”

---

# 🔧 **DETERMINING INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS**

3 main ways:

### 1️⃣ Asking

* Open ended questions
* Closed ended questions
* Brainstorming
* Delphi method → anonymous group consensus (no peer pressure 😎)

### 2️⃣ Existing system analysis

* Data analysis
* Decision analysis → break problems into small pieces

### 3️⃣ Prototyping

This is like building a sample system → letting users try → they realize 10 new requirements → repeat until they stop complaining.

---

# 🧱 **COMPONENTS OF PROBLEM DEFINITION**

When defining problem, describe:

* System function
* Inputs/Outputs
* People involved
* Environment
* Goals
* Constraints
* Performance measures
  (All the boring but important stuff.)

---

# 🏗️ **FACT FINDING TECHNIQUES**

1. **Documents review**
   But manuals are usually older than dinosaurs…

2. **On-site observation**
   You watch people do their job. Like NatGeo wildlife filming.

3. **Interviews & questionnaires**
   More flexible but dependent on how honest the person is.

---

# 💸 **FEASIBILITY STUDY**

Check:

* Is it technically possible?
* Is it economically possible?
* Is it operationally acceptable?

If yes → go ahead
If no → bin it

---

# 🤑 **COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS (CBA)**

Imagine comparing:

* **Costs** = money spent
* **Benefits** = money saved or earned

Find out if the project is a hero or zero.

---

# 💰 TYPES OF COSTS

### **Development Costs** (one-time)

* Wages
* Equipment
* Consultant fees
* Supplies

### **Operating Costs** (recurring)

* Maintenance
* Electricity
* Staff salaries
* Consumables

### **Other cost categories**

* Hardware/software
* Personnel
* Facilities
* Supplies

---

# 🎁 **TYPES OF BENEFITS**

* Increase income
* Reduce costs
* Increase speed
* Reduce errors
* Better customer satisfaction
  (Basically anything good)

Benefits can be:

* **Tangible** → measurable
* **Intangible** → emotional, satisfaction
* **Direct** → tied to the system
* **Indirect** → side-benefits
* **Fixed** → don’t change
* **Variable** → change on usage

---

# 📉 **EVALUATION METHODS**

### 🔹 **1. Net Benefit Analysis**

Benefits – Costs = Profit
Simple, sweet, but doesn’t consider time value of money

---

### 🔹 **2. Present Value Analysis**

Today's value of future money.
Formula:  P = F / (1+i)^n

Remember:
Future money is like future promises… worth less 😂

---

### 🔹 **3. Net Present Value (NPV)**

NPV = Total discounted benefits – Costs
Positive value = GO FOR IT 💪

---

### 🔹 **4. Payback Period**

How long to recover investment?
Shorter = safer

---

### 🔹 **5. Break Even Analysis**

Point where new system cost = old system cost
After that → profits

---

### 🔹 **6. Cash Flow Analysis**

Tracks inflow & outflow over time

---

# 🧠 **SUMMARY TO REMEMBER EASILY**

Think of this whole chapter like:

> You’re a detective (analyst)
> investigating a crime (problem)
> interviewing witnesses (users)
> gathering clues (data)
> solving mystery (analysis)
> proposing a solution (system)
> and checking if the mission is worth the money (CBA)
