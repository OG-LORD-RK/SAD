Alright buddy, buckle up — I’m gonna break this entire PDF down *cleanly, chunk by chunk*, but in a fun, sticky, exam-ready way so you don’t forget anything.
I’ll be your hype-man + explainer combo. 😎
(And yes, every detail from the PDF **will** be covered.)

## 🔥 **SYSTEM SECURITY — THE FUN, BRAIN-FRIENDLY GUIDE**

*(Everything below is from your PDF, just explained like you and I are sitting with chai.)*

---

# 🧱 **1. What Even IS System Security?**

Think of a computer system like your house.
System security = making sure:

* **Nobody steals your stuff** (theft prevention)
* **Nobody sneaks in** (unauthorized access)
* **Nobody breaks or changes things** (modification protection)
* **Nothing gets ruined accidentally** (damage control)

System security covers:

* 💾 **Data** (the files, information)
* 📦 **Software** (programs)
* 🖥️ **Hardware** (physical machine)

Your PDF splits problems into 4 heroes/villains:

### 🛡️ **Security**

Protection from attacks (hackers, viruses, disasters).

### 🧬 **Integrity**

Things should stay correct and untampered.

* System integrity → hardware + OS behave properly
* Data integrity → data stays accurate

### 🤫 **Privacy**

Your right to control who sees what about you.

### 🔒 **Confidentiality**

Extra-protected info; only selected people get access.

⚡ *Quick memory hack:*

> **SIPC** = Security, Integrity, Privacy, Confidentiality
> Imagine it as **SIPC—like a SIPP cup** that protects everything inside.

---

# 🌪️ **2. THREATS — The Bad Guys**

Think of these as the “villains” attacking your system.

### 1️⃣ **Errors & Omissions**

Accidental oopsies: wrong transactions, double orders, typo disasters.

### 2️⃣ **Disgruntled/Dishonest Employees**

The scary ones — internal villains.
They know the system → they abuse trust, steal data, modify entries.

### 3️⃣ **Fire**

Burnt servers = tears. Needs power, AC, safety planning.

### 4️⃣ **Natural Disasters**

Floods, storms, lightning—aka “nature trolling your system.”

### 5️⃣ **External Attacks**

Hackers, phishing, malware.
Your classic movie-villain vibe.

---

# 🎯 **3. RISK ANALYSIS — Detective Mode ON**

Risk = “something bad *might* happen.”

Risk analysis =

> Find vulnerabilities → check impact → estimate cost → make a plan.

### 🧪 **Purpose**

* Identify vulnerabilities
* See probability of disasters
* Estimate cost of disasters
* Decide preventive measures
* Prioritize biggest risks

### 📜 **Steps**

1. Identify every system component
2. List system objectives
3. Identify threats
4. Compare existing security vs exposures
5. Draft preventive + recovery measures

### 🧮 **Risk matrix basics**

* Higher cost × high probability = top priority
* Low probability → recovery measures may be enough
* Protect the things with highest financial loss

---

# 🧱 **4. CONTROL MEASURES — The Defense Army**

The PDF divides it into 4 big categories:

1. **Identification** (Who are you?)
2. **Access Control** (What can you touch?)
3. **Audit Controls** (Who did what?)
4. **System Integrity** (Is everything functioning right?)

---

## 🪪 **IDENTIFICATION**

Three types — think “Something You ____”

### 1. **Know** → Passwords

* Hard to guess
* Easy to remember
* Shouldn’t be recoverable except from your brain

### 2. **Are** → Biometrics

* Fingerprint
* Face scan
* Voice recognition

Matches real-time data with stored patterns.

### 3. **Have** → Cards/Keys

* Keycards
* Smart cards
  Often combined with passwords → 2FA vibes.

---

## 🚪 **ACCESS CONTROL — Bouncers of the System**

Methods:

### 🔑 Encoded Card System

Magnetic cards + keyboard + sometimes photo.

### 🔐 Encryption / Decryption

Scrambling messages → secure communication.
Encrypted there → decrypted by the right receiver.

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ Guidelines to Control Access

These sound like rules of a secret lab:

1. Single entrance + round-the-clock monitoring
2. Intruder alarms
3. Locks (key/cipher/badge)
4. Guard on duty
5. Issue new encoded badges; change locks periodically
6. Librarian controls file access
7. Register and label keys “DO NOT DUPLICATE”

### Against Fraud:

1. Password-protected programs
2. Always 2 people in computer room
3. Keep cheques/forms in safe
4. Control final program installation
5. Regular backups
6. Review software library

---

## 📑 **AUDIT CONTROLS**

Auditors → detectives who track “who did what, when, how”.

### 🕵️ **System Auditor**

* Ensures secure design from start
* Tracks usage and misuse
* Helps plan hardware + software specs

### 🧾 **Audit Trail (Audit Log)**

Records:

* Who accessed
* What they did
* When they did it

Useful for tracking changes, recovering lost transactions.

### 🪞 Audit Considerations

Look for:

* Misplaced functions
* Redundant processing
* Missing data
* Broken data flow
* Missed automation opportunities

---

## 🖥️ **SYSTEM INTEGRITY**

Ensure the system runs properly and safely.

Includes:

* Proper testing
* Physical security (fire, flood, theft)
* Regular backups
* Duplicate systems (mirroring)
* Backups off-site

### 🔥 Fire Safety

* Install sensors
* Wall-mounted extinguishers
* Fireproof infrastructure
* Remote storage of backups

### 🌊 Flood Safety

* Keep water pipes far
* Choose high-ground buildings
* Seal walls/ceilings for seepage prevention

### 🔁 Recovery Methods

**Rollforward** → start with backup → apply updates
**Rollback** → undo recent invalid actions

Failures:

1. **Catastrophic** → unreadable data → rollback
2. **Logical error** → incomplete transaction → rollback
3. **Structural damage** → pointer corrupted → restore from backup

---

# 💥 **DISASTER RECOVERY — When Everything Goes BOOM**

Goal:
Keep business alive even after disaster.

### 🧰 Choosing a recovery approach:

### 🏰 1. Fortress Approach

Full redundancy → safe but expensive.

### 🧊 2. Cold Backup

Empty site with electricity, AC.
Cheap but slow.

### 🌤 3. Warm Backup

Partner service bureau → faster, costlier.

### 🤝 4. Mutual Backup

Two companies help each other.
Cheap but finding partner is tough.

### 🧊🏠 5. Private Cold Site

Own empty facility → guaranteed access.

### 🔥🏠 6. Private Warm Site

Fully equipped backup system ready to go.
Very fast but expensive.

---

# 🎛️ **Disaster Recovery Planning Steps**

1. **Definition** → set objectives
2. **Requirements** → inventory of everything
3. **Design** → choose vendors, equipment
4. **Testing** → run backups, fix errors
5. **Manual** → final DR plan document

---

# ⚠️ **RISK MANAGEMENT — The Whole Strategy**

Risk = overlap of:

* Asset
* Threat
* Vulnerability

→ A + T + V

### Components:

* Threats
* Vulnerabilities
* Impact
* Likelihood

---

## 🧩 Risk Assessment Steps

1. **Risk Identification**
2. **Estimation**
3. **Evaluation**

---

## 📊 **Risk Estimation Types**

### 🧮 **1. Quantitative**

Uses math:

**ALE = SLE × ARO**

* SLE = value of single loss
* ARO = how often it happens per year

BUT hard because:

* Info value ≠ easy to calculate
* ARO is guesswork

So: not very reliable for IT systems.

---

### 🧘 **2. Qualitative**

Uses subjective levels:

* High
* Medium
* Low

Steps:

* Identify threats (natural, human, environmental)
* Identify vulnerabilities (scanners, pen-tests, audits)
* Pair threats ↔ vulnerabilities (T-V pair)
* Define likelihood
* Define impact
* Assess risk

Impact defined for:

* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability

Impact levels match:

* Limited
* Serious
* Severe

---

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation Techniques

1. **Assume** – accept it
2. **Avoid** – remove root cause
3. **Limit** – reduce impact
4. **Plan** – create mitigation plan
5. **Research** – study vulnerabilities
6. **Transfer** – insurance, outsourcing

---

## 📣 Risk Communication

Everyone must understand the risks.

---

## 🔁 Risk Monitoring

Security measures updated regularly.

---

## 🧪 IT Evaluation & Assessment

* Vulnerability scans
* Pen tests
* Monitoring events
* Update software
